# Overview

Contrastive Learners help learn mappings from input space to a compact Euclidean space where distances correspond to similarity measures. In the article recently published in "Journal of Manufacturing Processes [impact factor 5.6]" SME, we propose a strategy both in a supervised and semi-supervised manner to monitor the quality of the part built across the possible process spaces that could be simulated on Ti6Al4V grade 1 in a commercial L-DED machine from BeAM Machines. The optical emissions from the process zone, which are imaged co-axially, were distinguished using two deep learning-based contrastive learning frameworks and a methodology to track workpiece manufacturing quality in real-time is demonstrated. Considering the complicated melt pool morphology across process space in the L-DED process, similarity scores from the contrastive learners could also be used in other downstream tasks such as process control apart from process monitoring.
